Thatâ€™s why we created a system that enables:</p><ul><li>âœ… Real-time ratings â€“ Users can rate places, drivers, restaurants, or hotels based on how Jewish-friendly they are.</li><li>âœ… Live reports from the field â€“ All reports and experiences are stored in a database and made visible to the entire community.</li><li>âœ… Location-based alerts â€“ When a user reports an antisemitic or dangerous incident, everyone nearby receives an immediate alert, with relevant info and access to assistance.</li><li>âœ… Connections to local Jewish communities â€“ Easily find kosher places, Shabbat-friendly stays, and Jewish support centers.</li></ul><p>Our vision: to turn MagenTravel into a global mobile app that supports every Jewish traveler, anywhere.</p><p>ðŸ›¡ Weâ€™re just getting started â€“ and now is the time to get involved:</p><p>Weâ€™re reaching out to organizations and partners who care about Jewish safety and want to help us grow.
